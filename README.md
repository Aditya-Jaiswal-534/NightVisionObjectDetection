## 🔭 Project Overview

### The Challenge
Drones are critical tools for search and rescue, surveillance, and autonomous navigation. However, they typically struggle to operate at night because standard cameras and AI models rely on daylight visibility. Developing night-vision capabilities is often restricted by the high cost and scarcity of real-world night-vision training data.

### Our Solution
To solve the data shortage without expensive equipment, our team developed a pipeline to generate **synthetic night-vision data**. By using AI to translate standard daytime aerial images into night-vision imagery, we created a large-scale dataset entirely in the lab. This allowed us to train object detection models specifically for low-light environments.

### Impact
This project demonstrates that autonomous drones can be trained effectively using synthetic data, paving the way for cost-effective, round-the-clock UAV operations for safety and security applications.
